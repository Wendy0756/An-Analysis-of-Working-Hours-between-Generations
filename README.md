## About The Project

A nationwide pandemic has changed people’s working styles and brought the “work-life balance” topic to the public’s attention. Discussions on how generations (Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, Millenniums, Gen Zers) value work-life balance have been going on. This research aims to uncover the dynamics of working hours in generations and explore the extensive relationship between working hours, age, and other covariates that may influence typical weekly hours worked. Potential relevant features studied in this research include income, sex, marital status, number of children, job type (self-employment or not), and residence location. 

We analyzed various model specifications by evaluating global F-test, Rˆ2, Residual Standard Error as well as each explanatory variables t-test and coefficient value and direction. We begin with a simple functional form where Hours Worked is modeled as a function Age and iteratively add and test the addition of variables and their impact on model results and diagnostics.

### Data Source

The research is based on a data set extracted from the General Social Survey [(GSS)](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter).The original data set includes 72390 observations and 13 variables, including spouse working hours (“SPHR2”), tenure in occupation (“YEARSJOB”), and respondent id (“ID”).
